# V4 Development progress report #1
❌ = not done

➖ = semi done

✅ = completed


# Planned:
Image Support (thank @itzbloxxy for the idea)

Support discord server (Maybe)

Rename website (this is happening because PrivacyWebhook doesn't sound very catchy)

More content in updates, (sorry for making useless updates, v3 was just a option to downgrade to an older version of the website)

Also im working on another thing called discord webhook client. (sends messages as webhook but they arent embed messages and the website looks kinda like discord)

# Progress:

Discord webhook client   ✅

Images ❌

Rename ❌
